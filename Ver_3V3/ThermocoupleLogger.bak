Notes:\n\n1. Fabricate PCB in accordance with IPC-6012, Class 2; per IPC-6011.\n\n2. Materials:\n\n   (i)  Laminate and Prepreg (B-stage) to be in accordance with IPC-4101/21.\n   (ii) Copper foil to be in accordance with IPC-MF-150. Unless otherwise specified,\n       all copper weight for inner signal layers and inner plane layers to be 35um (1 oz.). \n       For outer layers 53um (1.5 oz). Copper weight is to be considered “finished”.\n\n3 All holes shall be located within 0.2 (0.008”) Diameter of True Position. \n  Layer to layer registration shall be within 0.125 (0.005”).\n\n4 Finish:\n\n   (i)   All exposed conductive pattern areas not covered with solder mask or other plating \n        shall be Hot Air Solder Leveled using eutectic Tin Lead Solder (Sn63/Pb37 ), per ANSI/J-STD-006 (HASL).\n   (ii)  Apply liquid photo imageable solder mask (color green) per IPC-SM-840, class H, to both sides\n        of the board over bare copper. Via holes covered with solder mask do not need to be plugged. \n        Only solder mask images that are the same size as the component pads may be enlarged, \n        and shall not be enlarged beyond 0.08 (0.003”) per side or 0.15 (0.006”) overall. \n        All other solder mask images shall not be enlarged.\n   (iii) Silkscreen shall be white, permanent, organic, non-conductive ink. \n        There shall be no silkscreen on any solderable component pad.\n\n5 Marking:\n\n   (i)  Board part number and revision letter is rendered in etch on the bottom side of the board. \n       Revision letter should be identical to this drawing.\n   (ii) UL logo, manufacturer’s identification and date code letter shall be rendered in etch \n       on the bottom side of the board approximately where shown.\n\n6 Test requirements:\n\n    100% net list electrical verification using customer supplied IPC-D-356 net list for opens and shorts.\n \n7 The supplier may add thieving to compensate for low copper density areas on this design.\n  Thieving shall not be added to within 3.8mm (0.150”) minimum distance to any existing feature. \n  There shall be no exposed thieving in any areas free of solder mask.\n\n8   Plate Edge Connector 0.8um (0.00003”) minimum gold thickness over 2.5um (0.0001”) minimum low stress nickel.\n
