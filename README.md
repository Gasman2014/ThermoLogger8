# ThermoLogger8


Just quickly pushed this repo if anyone is interested. It works in bradboard format and I have designed a PCB in KiCad. There is a 5v and 
a 3.3v version depending on choice of MC. I have been using Fosil as a VCS for this project and have just pushed the whole repo to GitHub.
If you are interested in the development history I could add the Fossil.repo.
