comment:      Updated multiple components with new component numbers to match PartKeepr database. Rerun KiBOM. The .csv file in this commit has had the Display line removed.
              Need to remove the display line as this seem to cause the K2PK script to fail - it continues to look up all component in the database. Probably related to this
              component not having a specific footprint. (user: johnpateman)
